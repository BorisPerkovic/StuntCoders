If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Right check, Doc. Back to the future. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.</div>
